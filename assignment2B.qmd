## Approach

This assignment is about classification model evaluation. Performance metrics for binary classification model could be confusion matrices: TP, FP, TN and FN.

I'll also showing accuracy, precision , recall and F1 score in table as a evaluation result.

Problems that I anticipated would be if I can find a way to effectively using visual to show result.
